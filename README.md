## A Simple bot that was designed to perform calculations and  using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

## How it Works....?

# Step 1:-

        1) IT ASKS USER TO INPUT HIS NAME IN BELOW PROVIDED TEXT BOX.
        
        2) AFTER ENTERING NAME IT CALLS THE FUNCTION GREETING.
        
        3) IT GREETS THE USER ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT TIME.
        
# Step 2:-

        1) NOW IT DISPLAYS THE TODO LIST AND ASKS FOR USER INPUT.
        
        2) USER SHOULD ENTER THE OPTION FROM GIVEN TODO LIST.
        
        3) NOW IT INVOKES THE FUNCTION THAT USER ASKED FOR.
 
# Step 3:-
    
        1) IF 1 IS THE OPTION IT ASKS FOR EXPRESSION FROM USER.
        
        2) IF THE EXPRESION IS INVALID IT GIVES INVALID EXPRESSION ELSE GIVES RESULT OF EXPRESSION
        
        3) AGAIN IT ASKS REPEATS FROM STEP 1.
     
# Step 4:-

        1) IF THE USER INPUTS 2 IT INVOKES IPL FUNCTION.
        
        2) IT GIVES THE MATCH WINNER OF PARTICULAR MATCH.
        
        4) AGAIN IT REPEATS FROM STEP 1.
        
# Step 5:-
        IF THE USER INPUTS 3 THEN THE BOT SAYS BYE AND QUITS.
